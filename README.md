[![HuggingFace Dataset](https://img.shields.io/badge/ü§ó-Datasets-ffce1c.svg)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jpwahle/dblp-discovery-dataset)

This repository provides metadata to papers from [DBLP](dblp.org) (> 5.9m articles, > 3.8m authors as of September 2022) crawled with the [cs-insights-crawler](https://github.com/gipplab/cs-insights-crawler).

> As of version 2.1 of the dataset and version 1.3.0 of the crawler, the dataset adds the [Computer Science Ontology](https://github.com/jpwahle/lrec22-d3-dataset/issues/1) with information about sub-fields. Also as of version 2.1 of the dataset, we support ü§ó [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jpwahle/dblp-discovery-dataset/).

> As of version 2.0 of the dataset and version 1.0.2 of the crawler, the dataset uses [SemanticScholar](https://semanticscholar.org) data. We will release a blog post soon about this update and how it affects porting from version 1.0.

The goal is to keep this corpus monthly updated and provide a comprehensive repository of the full DBLP collection.

This repository provides the following exports: 
1. üìñ All paper entries with metadata as jsonl: **size 2.7G** (gz) [download here](https://zenodo.org/record/6477785).
2. üôã All author entries with metadata as jsonl: **size 188M** (gz) [download here](https://zenodo.org/record/6477785).

Specifically, we develop a parallelized version of the second-order sequential best rotation (SBR2) algorithm for polynomial matrix EVD (PEVD). The proposed algorithm is an extension of the parallel Jacobi method to para-Hermitian polynomial matrices, as such it is the first architecture devoted to PEVD. Hardware implementation of the algorithm is achieved via a highly pipelined, non-systolic FPGA architecture. The proposed architecture is scalable in terms of the size of the input para-Hermitian matrix. We demonstrate the decomposition accuracy of the architecture through FPGA-in-the-loop hardware co-simulations. Results confirm that the proposed solution gives low execution times while reducing the number of resources required from the FPGA.',

The code to crawl this dataset was migrated to the [CS-Insights Project](https://github.com/gipplab/cs-insights-main) and now lives [here](https://github.com/gipplab/cs-insights-crawler).

We are hoping that this corpus can be helpful for analysis relevant to the computer science community.
